# Blubber Blasen
The awesome blubber blasen game. Right now it's a big mess. Use WASD or cursor keys to move, SPACE to fire a bubble.

There is a weird focus bug, you need to click into the game window first until you are able to move.

## Requirements
* Java JDK11
* Gradle 5.0

## Usage
Clone, build and run the application:
```
git clone https://github.com/skerkewitz/blubber-blasen.git
cd blubber-blasen
gradlew run
```
