# Blubber Blasen
The awesome blubber blasen game. Right now it's a big mess. Use cursor keys to move, SPACE to fire a bubble.

There is a weird focus bug, you need to click into the game window first until you are able to move.

## Requirements
* Java JDK11
* Gradle 5.0
* libGDX 1.9.9

## Usage
Clone, build and run the application:
```
git clone https://github.com/skerkewitz/blubber-blasen.git
cd blubber-blasen
gradlew run
```

## Gameplay
Trap monster in bubbles and then burst the bubble. After you killed all monster the next level will come up. If a monster touch you, you will die!

Currently, there are only two levels. After you cleared the second level you will go back to the first. Also if you die you need to restart the app.
